## A sticker generator built with Python!

### What does each thing mean

* `import requests` to requests an URL
* `import os` to create a new dir
*  OBS: Remembering that to install the requests library just type in the terminal or at the `pip install requests prompt`.

#

I think an important point to play is line 10. `os.makedir` will create a new folder in the project directory, where the stickers will be stored.
